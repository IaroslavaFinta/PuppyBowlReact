Puppy Bowl application using React

I built PuppyBowl, a web application using HTML, CSS, and React. The app allows users to view a roster of puppies, see player details, and add players to the roster by fetching and rendering data from an API.

Tools Used
HTML: Structured the content and layout.
CSS: Styled the application for a visually appealing and responsive design.
React: Enabled interactivity and dynamic data rendering.

Key Functionalities
View Roster: Fetch and display the puppy roster from the API.
Player Details: Click on a puppy to view detailed information.
Add Players: Add new players to the roster, with updates reflected dynamically.

Detailed Description
Front-End Development
HTML
Structure: Created a well-organized layout to display the puppy roster, individual player details, and forms for adding new players.
CSS
Styling: Applied styles for a cohesive and visually appealing design.
Responsive Design: Ensured the application looks good on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
React
Components: Developed reusable components for the roster, player details, and forms.
State Management: Used React state to manage the application’s dynamic data.
API Integration: Utilized React lifecycle methods and hooks to fetch and render data from the API.
Event Handling: Implemented event listeners to handle user actions such as viewing player details and adding players.

Integration Workflow
HTML Layout: Structured the application with sections for the roster, player details, and forms.
CSS Styling: Applied styles to ensure an appealing and user-friendly interface.
React Functionality:
API Requests: Used fetch or axios to get data from the API and manage the responses.
Rendering Data: Dynamically displayed the roster and player details based on API responses.
Form Handling: Allowed users to add new players to the roster, updating the state and re-rendering the components.
Event Listeners: Managed user interactions for viewing player details and submitting forms.

Example Workflow
Viewing the Roster: On loading the application, React fetches the roster data from the API and displays it using components.
Viewing Player Details: Users click on a player's name to view more details, with React fetching and displaying the specific player’s data.
Adding a Player: Users fill out a form to add a new player. React handles the form submission, sends the new player data to the API, and updates the roster display with the new player.

By combining HTML, CSS, and React, I developed PuppyBowl to be a functional, interactive web application that allows users to manage and explore a dynamic roster of puppies, view detailed player information, and effectively manage the roster.
